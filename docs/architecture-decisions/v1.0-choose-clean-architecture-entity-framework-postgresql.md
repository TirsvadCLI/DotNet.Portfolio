# Choose Clean Architecture, Entity Framework, and PostgreSQL as Default Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Changelog
- v1.0 (2024-06-07): Initial decision record created.

## 1. Clean Architecture

### Context
To ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable foundation for our .NET 10 projects, we require an architecture that supports clear separation of concerns, testability, and flexibility for future changes. The team values maintainability and the ability to evolve the system over time.

### Decision
Adopt Clean Architecture to enforce separation of concerns, improve testability, and enable independent evolution of business logic, infrastructure, and UI.

### Rationale
Clean Architecture allows for clear boundaries between core business logic and external concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend. It supports test-driven development and enables the team to swap out infrastructure or UI technologies with minimal impact on the domain logic.

### Consequences
- The project structure will follow Clean Architecture principles, with separate projects for Domain, Core, Infrastructure, and UI layers.
- Developers must adhere to dependency rules and maintain clear boundaries between layers.

## 2. Entity Framework (EF Core)

### Context
We need a reliable, productive ORM for .NET 10 that integrates well with our technology stack and supports rapid development, migrations, and LINQ queries.

### Decision
Use Entity Framework Core as the ORM for all data access.

### Rationale
Entity Framework Core provides a familiar, productive data access experience for .NET developers, with LINQ support, migrations, and strong community backing. It is well-supported in the .NET ecosystem and aligns with our team's experience.

### Consequences
- All data access will be implemented using Entity Framework Core.
- Developers will use EF Core migrations for schema changes.
- The team will follow best practices for EF Core usage and performance.

## 3. PostgreSQL

### Context
We require a modern, open-source relational database that is reliable, feature-rich, and well-supported in both development and production environments.

### Decision
Select PostgreSQL as the default database for all environments.

### Rationale
PostgreSQL offers advanced SQL features, strong performance, reliability, and is widely supported in cloud and on-premises environments. It is open-source and has a large, active community.

### Consequences
- PostgreSQL will be the default database for all environments.
- Configuration and scripts will be provided for PostgreSQL setup.
- The team will leverage PostgreSQL features for scalability and reliability.
